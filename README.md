**Know Your Path - Safer Hyperlinks**

A URL shortener service that adds content warnings to links before redirecting users.

## About

kypsh (pronounced "kip-sh") lets you share links with built-in content warnings. When users click a kypsh link, they see a brief warning about the content they're about to view, giving them the choice to proceed or exit.

## Features

- **URL Shortening**: Create compact links that redirect to your original URLs
- **Content Warnings**: Add standardized or custom warning messages
- **Warning Categories**:
  - NSFW (Not Safe For Work)
  - Potentially Triggering
  - Custom Warnings
- **Clean Interface**: Simple, accessible, and mobile-friendly design

## How It Works

1. Enter the URL you want to share
2. Select a warning category or create a custom message
3. Customize warning appearance (optional)
4. Get your shortened URL (kyp.sh/xyz)
5. When someone accesses your link, they'll see the warning before proceeding

## Example

Original link:
```
https://example.com/very-long-article-about-sensitive-political-topics-from-2023
```

Shortened link with warning:
```
https://kyp.sh/p7k2x
```

## Use Cases

- Sharing sensitive or potentially triggering content
- Providing context before users visit a site
- Educational contexts where content warnings are appropriate
- Professional settings when sharing links that might not be safe for work
- Phishing training simulations with clear warnings
